Notes on usage of Biome-BGCMuSo v4.0.3
______________________________________


Biome-BGCMuSo was developed from Biome-BGC v4.1.1 Max Planck Institute version, so extended command line options are not available that are implemented in Biome-BGC v4.2 [see master branch].
Usage of the model is simple. Using the example dataset the simulation can be triggered from the command line by issuing the command:

muso4 spinup.ini

and then 

muso4 normal.ini

[note that you have to compile the code under Linux first, or get the Windows executable [including cygwin.dll] from this link:
http://nimbus.elte.hu/bbgc/files/muso4.zip

In the provided example [sample_input_data_HU-He2.zip] all files should be placed into one directory. 
Note that the input and outuput files are typically organized into subdirectories, as they are provided for Biome-BGC v4.2 in the master branch:
https://github.com/bpbond/Biome-BGC
If this solution is selected, then the subdirectory names must be indicated in the INI files. See the sample INI files in the master branch.
