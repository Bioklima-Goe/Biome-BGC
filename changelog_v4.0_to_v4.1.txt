Bug fixes within the tipping bucket method: tipping.c

Bug fixes within the DSSAT soil temperature estimation method: multilayer_tsoil.c

Bug fixes within the hydrological calculation method: groundwater.c, multilayer_hydrolparams.c and multilayer_hydrolprocess.c

Bug fixes within GDD calculation method: daymet.c

Bug fixes within soil variables initalization: firstday.c

Slight change of the model logic: bottom inacitve layer is now part of the soil system - which means that water/nitrogen flows from (or into) the bottom layer is net sink (or source) to the soil system. In this version soil parameters refers to all 6 layers instead of only the active layers (conduct_calc.c).

Bug fixes within the decomposition routine: decomposition.c

Bug fixes in spinup_bgc.c and bgc.c (writing log file)

Bug fixes in bgc_constant.h: grazing parameters from 14 to 15

Bug fixes within the tipping bucket method: tipping.c

Bug fixes in RCN number:sitec.c

Bug fixes in metday of transient run: transient_bgc.c

New feature: ann.txt of spinup run now contains data from transient run: transient_bgc.c

Bug fixes in ploughing: now cut-down biomass returns to ploughing pool

Bug fixes in mortality: now standing dead and cut-down biomass is affected by fire

New variable: N content of cut-down dead biomass (output_map[330] = &ns->CTDBn)

Changed variables name: standing and cut-down dead biomass pools

New variable: daily_N2O - sum of daily N2O fluxes (based on empirical estimation) in kgN/m2/d (output_map[611] = &summary->daily_N2O)

Bug fixes in tsoil_avg calculation

Bug fixes in array definition: some of the variables are handled as double instead of float
