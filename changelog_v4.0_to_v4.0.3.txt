Bug fixes within GDD calculation method: daymet.c

Bug fixes within soil variables initalization: firstday.c

Slight change of the model logic: bottom inacitve layer is now part of the soil system - which means that water/nitrogen flows from (or into) the bottom layer is net sink (or source) to the soil system. In this version soil parameters refers to all 6 layers instead of only the active layers (conduct_calc.c).

Bug fixes within the decomposition routine.

Bug fixes in spinup_bgc.c and bgc.c (writing GSI and contol file)
